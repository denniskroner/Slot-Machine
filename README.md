# Slot-Machine
Game using Python, OOP, Jupyter Notebook

When the slot machine begins, the player is asked to place a bet from their initial credit (defaults to 10). For each play of the slot machine there are three possible outcomes:
    1. Full house​ – all 3 columns contain the same value. Player wins an amount equal to the bet and this is added to their 
        credit.
    2. Half house​ – 2 of the 3 columns contain the same value. Player wins half the amount bet (both bets in Figure 1).
    3. Empty house​ - all 3 columns contain different values. Player loses bet.
The player can exit the game at any time by typing ‘N’.
